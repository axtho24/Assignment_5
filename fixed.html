      <p>The function was missing the keyword return, which would make the function useless
         because any type of value we would have used it would have turn back as undefined</p>

      <p>For this problem the function wasn't given an <span>Argument name</span>, so even
         though the return was specified for using name, it didn't use anything because we
         didn't use name as the argument.</p>

      <p>The 'var i' started with 1 instead 0 which prevented the function from using all the arrays
         and instead started using the second word or letter.</p>

      <p>The function only had one '=' which is for assigning a value, what we needed was three '==='
         using three equal signs is used for comparing, which is what we want to do, compare the days
         of the week to determine what result the function will give us.</p>

      <p>The function was missing a closing brace at the beginning of the first if statement,
        give us an error from the start and not able to run the function at all. </p>

      <p>The following function is use to calculate how much a server should receive depending on their
         performance, therefore two arguments are needed, just as written in the function. One of the values
         being mealCost, which when recorded will simply use that number, the second argument is a bit more
         complicated, service level is defined by certain specified strings but those strings alone don't
         values to use within the function, that's why within the function there a 'let' statement which
         defines and limits us to a certain words we can use for service and lets us know that aside from
         only use those words, they are given a numerical value inside the 'let' statement to then be useable
         to the function. Now that all of that is declared we have the return statement, which is a mathematical
         problem, once the values for the arguments are declared the function will be executed and what we
         will see would be a result of the math problem being solved with the values we used.</p>
